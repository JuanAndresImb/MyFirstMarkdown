# How Does the Internet Work?

**Most of us know how to use the internet without actually understanding how it works.** It's similar to electricity in your home - used daily but often not fully understood. If the electric grid is difficult to grasp, the internet might seem impossible to understand. **Wrong.**

**In the next few minutes, I'll explain how the internet works, putting you in the top 10% of people who understand its basics.** For [Security Catalyst](https://www.securitycatalyst.com), I'm Aaron Titus.

## Common Misconception

When people think of the internet, they often imagine a "bubble cloud." However, **the internet is not a cloud**. The cloud metaphor was created by those more concerned with job security than education.

## What is the Internet?

**The internet is a wire**, often buried in the ground. It can be:

- **Fiber optics**
- **Copper**
- **Satellite beams**
- **Cell phone networks**

### Servers and Clients

- **Server**: A special computer connected directly to the internet with unique Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, akin to postal addresses.
- **Clients**: Regular computers (like yours) that connect indirectly to the internet via an Internet Service Provider (ISP).

## How Connections Work

### Example Scenario

1. **Connecting to a website**: 
    - **Your home laptop** (client) connects to the internet via an ISP (e.g., DSL).
    - When you visit a website (e.g., AOL.com), your computer communicates with the server hosting that site.
  
2. **Sending an email**:
    - **Compose an email**: Using a service like Gmail.
    - **Recipient's server**: The email is sent to the recipient's server (e.g., AOL).
    - **Retrieving the email**: The recipient retrieves the email from their server.

## Data Transmission

Whenever data (emails, pictures, web pages) travels across the internet, it is **broken into smaller pieces called packets**. These packets are reassembled at their destination.

## Maintaining Privacy

When two people (e.g., you and your boss) are online, packets are sent back and forth. **IP addresses and routers ensure that packets go to the correct destination**, preventing embarrassing mix-ups.

### Routers

- **Function**: Direct packets around the internet.
- **Process**: Each router adds its own IP address to the packet, ensuring it reaches its destination. When the server responds, packets are sent back through the same process until they reach your computer.

## Conclusion

**Understanding the internet places you in the top 10% of knowledgeable users.**
